# Eat-Da-Burger
Eat-Da-Burger is a user inactive application where any burger you can imagine can be ordered. Once submitted it will populate the other burgers waiting to be eaten! YUM! Once a burger is decided upon the customer enters their name and eats it. After completeing their meal, the burger is removed from the menu and placed with a history of devoured burgers!
